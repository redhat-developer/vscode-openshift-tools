## Overview

A Visual Studio Code extension for interacting with Red Hat OpenShift using a local instance of OpenShift clusters providing a streamlined developer experience. This extension is currently in Preview Mode and supports only Java and Node.js components. We will be supporting other languages in the future releases.

To run the instance of OpenShift cluster locally, developers can use [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) / [CDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/). Currently all clusters are supported, but with some limitations for OpenShift Online Pro where additional storage might be required to create more that two components.

## Commands and features

![ screencast ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/master/images/vscode-openshift-tools.gif)

`vs-openshift-connector` supports a number of commands & actions for interacting with OpenShift clusters; these are accessible via the command menu (`Cmd+Shift+P` <kbd>⌘⇧P</kbd> on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` <kbd>⌃⇧P</kbd> on Windows and Linux) and may be bound to keys in the normal way.

### General Commands

* `OpenShift: Log in to cluster` - Log in to your server and save login for subsequent use.
    * Credentials : Log in to the given server with the given credentials.
    * Token : Login using bearer token for authentication to the API server.
* `OpenShift: List catalog components` - List all available component types from OpenShift's Image Builder.
* `OpenShift: List catalog services` - Lists all available services e.g. mysql
* `OpenShift: New Project` - Create new project inside the cluster.
* `OpenShift: About` - Provides the information about the OpenShift tools.
* `OpenShift: Log out` - Logs out of the current OpenShift cluster.

#### Actions available inside an OpenShift Cluster Project

   * `Project -> New Application` - Create a new application inside the selected project.
   * `Project -> Delete` - Delete an existing project.

#### Actions available for an Application inside a Project

   * `Application ->  New Component` - Create a new component inside the selected application.
        * git - Use a git repository as the source file for the component.
        * local - Use local directory as a source file for the component.
   * `Application ->  New Service` - Perform service catalog operations.
   * `Application -> Describe` - Describe the given application in terminal window.
   * `Application -> Delete` - Delete an existing application.

#### Actions available for a Component in an Application

   * `Component -> Create URL` - Expose component to the outside world. The URLs that are generated using this command, can be used to access the deployed components from outside the cluster.
   * `Component -> Create Storage` - Create storage and mount to a component.
   * `Component ->  Show Log` - Retrieve the log for the given component.
   * `Component ->  Follow Log` - Follow logs for the given component.
   * `Component ->  Link` - Link component to a service or component.
      * link adds the appropriate secret to the environment of the source component. The source component can then consume the entries of the secret as environment variables.
   * `Component -> Open in Browser` - Open the exposed URL in a browser.
   * `Component -> Push` - Push source code to a component.
   * `Component -> Watch` - Watch for changes, update component on change.
   * `Component -> Describe` - Describe the given component in terminal window.
   * `Component -> Delete` - Delete an existing component.

#### Actions available inside a storage for a component

   * `Storage -> Delete` - Delete storage from component.

### Extension Configuration Settings
   * `Openshift Connector: Show Channel On Output` - Show OpenShift Connector output channel when new text added to output stream.

### Dependencies

This extension uses two CLI tools to interact with OpenShift cluster:
* OKD CLI client tool - [oc](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases)
* OpenShift Do tool - [odo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/releases)

> If `oc` and `odo` tools are located in a directory from `PATH` environment variable they will be used automatically. 
The extension will detect these dependencies and prompt the user to install if they are missing - choose `Download & Install` when you see an notification for the missing tool.

**NOTE:** This extension is in Preview mode. So the extension support for OpenShift is strictly experimental - assumptions may break, and commands and behavior may change!
