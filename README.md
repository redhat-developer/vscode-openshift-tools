## Overview

A Visual Studio Code extension for interacting with Red Hat OpenShift cluster. This extension is currently in Preview Mode and supports only Java and Node.js components. We will be supporting other languages in the future releases.

To run the instance of OpenShift cluster locally, developers can use [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases) / [CDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/). Currently all clusters are supported, but with some limitations for OpenShift Online Pro where additional storage might be required to create more than two components.

For detail analysis of how to setup and run local OpenShift Cluster using minishift, please follow this [wiki](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/wiki/Starting-Local-OpenShift-Instance).

## WARNING !! Breaking Changes

This release(`0.1.0`) requires below mentioned changes. Use the migration guide mentioned below to resolve them.

* This breaks backward compatibility with older versions(`<=0.0.23`).
* Components created with previous version will no longer be identified. Therefore after extension is updated to new version(`0.1.0`) all previously deployed components won't be visible in OpenShift Application View.
* Every component/service needs to have a context folder. The extension will prompt the user to specify the context folder with the creation of component/service.

> **Please follow the [migration](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/wiki/Migration-to-v0.1.0) guide to resolve any possible issues.**

### Extension Configuration Settings
   * `OpenShift Connector: Show Channel On Output` - Show OpenShift Connector output channel when new text added to output stream
   * `OpenShift Connector: Output verbosity level` - Output verbosity level (value between 0 and 9) for OpenShift Create, Push and Watch commands in output channel and terminal view

### Dependencies

#### CLI Tools

This extension uses two CLI tools to interact with OpenShift cluster:
* OKD CLI client tool - [oc](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases)
* OpenShift Do tool - [odo](https://github.com/openshift/odo/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta5)

> If `oc` and `odo` tools are located in a directory from `PATH` environment variable they will be used automatically. 
The extension will detect these dependencies and prompt the user to install if they are missing or have not supported version - choose `Download & Install` when you see an notification for the missing tool.

#### Extensions

This extension depends on Kubernetes Extension from Microsoft which is going to be installed automatically along with OpenShift Connector Extension. Latter is using Kubernetes Extension public API to show
OpenShift specific resources like Projects, Routes, Deployment Configs, Image Streams and Templates in Kubernetes Clusters View. Those resources are visible only for OpenShift clusters. 

OpenShift Connector extension also provides ```Use Project``` command to switch between OpenShift Projects in Kubernetes Clusters View.

**NOTE:** This extension is in Preview mode. The extension support for OpenShift is strictly experimental - assumptions may break, commands and behavior may change!
