### Supported OpenShift Clusters

#### Developer Sandbox

The extension allows users free access to the [Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift](http://workspaces.openshift.com/). From `Add Cluster View`, users will be redirected to the dev sandbox instance. The sandbox provides you with a private OpenShift environment in a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster that is pre-configured with a set of developer tools.

#### Local instance of OpenShift

This extension can work with local or remote OpenShift clusters.

To provision local instance of OpenShift cluster, developers can use the following options:
* [Red Hat CodeReady Containers](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/) - run single node local OpenShift 4.x cluster
* [minishift](http://bit.ly/3rSvzOx) / [CDK](http://red.ht/3opF1XC) - run single node local OpenShift 3.x cluster

For detail analysis of how to setup and run local OpenShift Cluster using minishift, please follow this [wiki](http://bit.ly/3be4jUv).

#### Public cloud providers

If developers can't run OpenShift cluster locally, the extension can work with remote one provisioned with one of Red Hat products:

* [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](http://red.ht/3rUUzoe) - build, deploy and manage your applications across cloud- and on-premise infrastructure
* [Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated](http://red.ht/3bdr7E8) - single-tenant, high-availability Kubernetes clusters in the public cloud
* [Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift](http://red.ht/3oeVPjM) - fully managed Red Hat OpenShift service on Microsoft Azure
* [Red Hat OpenShift Online](http://red.ht/3bbSVso) - the fastest way for developers to build, host and scale applications in the public cloud

To install OpenShift Container Platform 4 in the public cloud, in your datacenter or on your laptop please visit [Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager](http://red.ht/3rSwjTP).

**NOTE:** When working with [Red Hat OpenShift Online](http://red.ht/3bbSVso) remote cluster only one component can be created for Starter plan and Pro plan with default 2GiB storage. If you want to create multi component application you could opt in for Pro plan with bigger persistence storage (up to 150GiB).

## Core Concepts

* `Project`: A project is your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.

* `Application`: An application is a program designed for end users. An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application. Examples of applications: e-Shop, Hotel Reservation System, Online Booking

* `Component`: A component is a set of Kubernetes resources which host code or data. Each component can be run and deployed separately. Examples of components: Warehouse API Backend, Inventory API, Web Frontend, Payment Backend

* `Service`: A service is software that your component links to or depends on. Examples of services: MariaDB, MySQL.

* `Devfile`: A portable file responsible for your entire reproducable development environment.

##  Commands and Features

The extension supports a number of commands to interact with OpenShift clusters and resources. The commands are accessible via the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` <kbd>⌘⇧P</kbd> on macOS or `Ctrl+Shift+P` <kbd>⌃⇧P</kbd> on Windows and Linux), Visual Studio Code View title buttons and tree context menus.

### Commands Available in OpenShift Application Explorer View

### Running OpenShift Locally

The extension provides a view to run local instance of OpenShift. To open the view use `Add OpenShift Cluster` button
![ addclusterbutton ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/master/images/add-cluster-button.gif)
from `OpenShift: Application Explorer` view title.

![ addcluster ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/master/images/add-cluster.gif)

The view guides you through the steps required to create and start OpenShift 4 single node cluster on your workstation
using Red Hat CodeReady Containers:

   * Download & Configure Red Hat CodeReady Containers
   * Set Virtual Machine parameters: number of CPUs and memory amount
   * Setup Red Hat CodeReady Containers
   * Run Red Hat CodeReady Containers commands to control the cluster

The view provides UI to control cluster's state:

   * Start cluster
   * Stop cluster
   * Open OpenShift Developer Console for cluster
   * Refresh cluster's state

### Debug Support

   * Supports Local Node.js and Java Components
   * Does not support git and binary based components

`OpenShift: Debug` command simplifies the way to start debugging for OpenShift Components pushed to a cluster. It is an experimental feature, because it is using experimental odo `debug` command under the hood and supports only local Java and Node.js components. The command is available from command palette and context menu for Component nodes in OpenShift Application Explorer view.

#### Debug Node.js Component

Default Visual Studio Code installation includes JavaScript/TypeScript Language Support and Debugger Extensions required to debug a Node.js Component. That means new `OpenShift: Debug` command can be used without installing any additional extensions.

![ screencast ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/master/images/gif/debug-node.gif)

#### Debug Java Component

To debug a Java Component, [Java Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java) and [Java Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug) Extensions are required. OpenShift Connector extension will prompt the user to install missing extension(s) before it starts Debugger for a Java Component.

## Dependencies

### CLI Tools

This extension uses two CLI tools to interact with OpenShift cluster:
* OKD CLI client tool - [oc](http://red.ht/3s0jSW7)
* odo - [odo](https://red.ht/3p7usI3)

> `oc` and `odo` tools for Windows, Linux and macOS are included into extension package. Once the extension is installed it is ready to use.

The extension version `0.2.4` includes `odo` CLI tool `v2.0.7` and supports devfile in addition to S2I (Source-to-Image) components. Devfiles are new way of deploying a component with odo.
Follow the links below for additional information:

* [Understanding odo](https://bit.ly/3ovRTuY)
* [Devfile file reference](http://bit.ly/3hNrhTP)
* [Deploying your first application using odo](http://bit.ly/2MurLCG)

### Extensions

This extension depends on [Kubernetes Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) from Microsoft which is going to be installed automatically along with OpenShift Connector Extension. Latter is using Kubernetes Extension public API to show
OpenShift specific resources like Projects, Routes, Deployment Configs, Image Streams and Templates in Kubernetes Clusters View. Those resources are visible only for OpenShift clusters.

OpenShift Connector extension also provides ```Use Project``` command to switch between OpenShift Projects in Kubernetes Clusters View.

![ useproject ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/vscode-openshift-tools/master/images/use-project.png)

**NOTE:** This extension is in Preview mode. The extension support for OpenShift is strictly experimental - assumptions may break, commands and behavior may change!

## Breaking Changes Between Previous Releases

### Updating from release `0.0.23` or earlier

* The Components created with previous versions(<=0.0.23) will no longer be visible in OpenShift Application Explorer view.
* The Extension will prompt the user to specify the context folder when creating new Components and then add selected folder to workspace.
* New Component, Url and Storage objects are created locally in context folder and not immediately pushed to the cluster.
