# Known Problems

## Trigger github-actions build after failure related to infrastructure

If build fails because it cannot download oc and odo binaries, there is no way to trigger new
build through github.com ui. To trigger new build just use

```
git commit --allow-empty -m "restart github-actions build"
git push
```

Then after build is green squash commit while releasing your PR changes to the master branch.

## Local cluster started with minishift v1.29.0+ has no access to images from registry.redhat.io

Before applying `xpaas` add-on run apply `redhat-registry-login` with this command

`minishift addon apply redhat-registry-login --addon-env REGISTRY_USERNAME=username --addon-env REGISTRY_PASSWORD=password`

where `username` and `password` are your credentials to access registry.redhat.io.
Then apply `xpaas` with the command below

`minishift addon apply xpaas`
